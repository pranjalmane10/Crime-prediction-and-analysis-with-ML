# Crime-prediction-and-analysis-with-ML
Language    Python Jupyter and Flask Technology Visual Data Analysis Algorithm KNN (K-Nearest neighbors) . We have build the easiest crime analysis and prediction in Jupyter which will predict and analysis crimes in SF. Dataset was taken from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime for dataset
To run
Steps to run:
1. first of all open anaconda prompt, go to the location of downloaded folder(CrimePredictionFlaskTesting)
2. Run command : pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Then open crimeprediction.ipnyb (jupyter notebook)
4. Run all the cells till pickle statement cell
5. Now run app.py from the terminal
6. You will get the link open it
7. Enter the data from Train.csv file to test the output(cross check with the data given under category section)
8. And then you can take data from test.csv file and get the output
9. Walla your Crime Prediction Web App is running.....
REMEMBER TO DOWNLOAD ALL TRAINING AND TEST CSV FROM KAGGLE 
YOU CAN FIND MORE LOGICS ON KAGGLE TOO TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS, SO DONT GIVE UP IF IT DOESNT WORK!!!!
